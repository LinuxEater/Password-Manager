# Tkinter CRUD with SQLite

This project is a simple desktop application developed in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and SQLite as the database. The system allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a users table.

---

## Features

- Add new users with basic information.
- View the list of registered users.
- Edit existing user information.
- Delete users from the database.
- Export the users list to a CSV file.
- Interactive menu for easier navigation.
- Confirmation and error messages for better user experience.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- SQLite3 (Relational database)
- CSV (Data export)

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://your-repository.git
cd project-folder
```

2. **Install dependencies (if needed):**

Tkinter usually comes with Python, but if necessary, install it via:

- On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

3. **Run the main script:**

```bash
python3 your_script.py
```

---

## Project Structure

- `your_script.py` - Main script containing Tkinter interface and CRUD logic.
- `data_base.db` - SQLite database file created automatically.
- `users.csv` - File generated during data export.

---

## Usage

- Open the application.
- Use the form to add users.
- Use buttons to edit or delete selected records.
- Use the menu option to export data as CSV.

---

## Future Improvements

- Implement more robust form validation.
- Add user authentication.
- Improve the GUI for better usability and responsiveness.
- Add integration with other export formats (JSON, Excel).
